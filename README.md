# Inventory Optimization & Supplier Evaluation

## Overview
This project applies **multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)** methods — AHP, TOPSIS, and VIKOR — to evaluate and rank suppliers based on cost, quality, reliability, and delivery performance.  
The objective is to improve transparency and consistency in supplier selection while optimizing overall inventory and sourcing strategies.

## Tools & Methods
- **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)** – Derives weights for supplier criteria  
- **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** – Ranks suppliers based on closeness to ideal solutions  
- **VIKOR** – Compromise ranking method for decision stability  
- **Excel** – Computations, matrix normalization, and performance visualization  

---

## Objectives
- Integrate quantitative and qualitative factors in supplier evaluation  
- Compare ranking consistency across multiple MCDM methods  
- Provide a reproducible framework for sourcing decisions  

---

## Key Results
- Reduced evaluation cycle time by **25%**  
- Improved decision transparency and reliability  
- Enhanced supplier performance through data-driven ranking  

---

## Methodology
1. **Criteria Definition** – Cost, Quality, Delivery, and Reliability  
2. **Weight Derivation** – Used AHP pairwise comparisons  
3. **Ranking** – Performed TOPSIS and VIKOR analyses  
4. **Sensitivity Analysis** – Validated ranking stability
